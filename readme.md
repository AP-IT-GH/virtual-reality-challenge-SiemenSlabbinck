# Virtual Reality Challenge Slabbinck Siemen
## 3D Painting
### Taken voltooid:
- The Canvas that allows you to change the shape on the pedestal follows the camera, This canvas should be stationary next to the pedestal. 
- The toggled ray and palette canvas are tracking the opposite hands, The palette should move with the left hand and, when you press the thumbstick or primary button on the right controller, the toggled ray should emit from the right hand.
- The paint brush activation is backwards, starting when the trigger is released and stopping when it’s pressed, The paintbrush should create a trail while the trigger is being held, stopping when the trigger is released.
- The medium brush size button turns invisible when pressed and makes the trail gigantic, The button should turn the same grey color as the other buttons when pressed and change the trail to a size in between the small and large brush sizes.
- The paint brush sound effect stays the same, regardless of how far it is from you, The paint brush sound should be at full volume close to your face, but about 50% volume when your arm is outstretched.
- There is no audio feedback from the UI, Add sound effects for all of the buttons in the UI and a continuous sound effect that plays while the paint brush is in use.
- There is no way to hide the pedestal completely, Add a toggle UI to the menu next to the pedestal that shows/hides the pedestal object when toggled on/off.
- There is no way to save your work, Add a “Print” button that creates a miniature version of your 3d creation on a table next to you.
- There is no way to paint on the back or sides of the object, Add a slider to the UI that rotates the entire pedestal, giving you the ability to paint the back as well.
